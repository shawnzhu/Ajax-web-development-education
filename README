INTRODUCTION

This is a single HTML based web app for students learning dojo from the very beginning.

I writed this app because most of the students are struggling with server-side heavey stuff, which is far from what is being tought. So let's focus on dojo only without touch server-side container.

USAGE
step1: write javascript code in the textarea
step2: click button "run"

EXAMPLE
fill the following snippet into the textarea:
        <script type="text/javascript">
        dojo.require("dojo.form.Button");
        //sample code:
        function helloworld() {alert("clicked button!");}
        </script>

        <button dojoType="dijit.form.Button" onclick="javascript:helloworld();">Hello World</button>

Then click the button "run", you will see dijit button there and it prompts "clicked button!" when you click it.
